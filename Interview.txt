  /*Dependancy Injection:
  * I researched and watched videos about the usefulness of this concept on an enterprise level
  * It does exactly as the name suggests: injects dependancies.
  * It does so in two ways: using the constuctor method AND Using the setter Method.
  * this is vital because it decouples your class construction from the construction of its DEPENDANCIES
  * often referred to as having the assistant do the heavy lifting
  * It is a principle that states code should only depend upon abstractions

/* How is hashig actually done?
* Although I could anser what a hashmap does/is, I could not answer how it was done, fully.
* Hashing has 3 parts to it: hash function, Hash value, and Hash bucket
* Hash function is hashCode that returns the integer value
* Hash value is the the value in which is returned by the hash function
* Hash bucket is used to store the key value pairs and is constructed by linked list
* Something I left out while for this when discussing, is that the hashmap is highly efficient for large sets of data.
* It provides us with a constant time of O(1) when retrieving values since it is not an iterative object.
